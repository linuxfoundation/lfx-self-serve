 * page that published `/agenda/`, or that drops `#day-2` from `/program#day-2`, has named the
 * right link in the wrong form; returning the page's form sends the recipient where the page
 * sends its own readers. The candidate's spelling is never emitted.
 *
 * The extraction that produces these candidates is an LLM reading page prose, and a model asked
 * for "the agenda URL" will happily compose a plausible one — `/schedule/`, `/agenda-2026/` —
 * from the site's URL shape when the page states none. The result is not an empty field but a
 * confident wrong one, and these URLs are printed as hyperlinks into a marketing email sent under
 * a real foundation's name. So a candidate is a HINT about which of the page's real links matters,
 * never itself a source of truth.
 *
 * `registrationUrl` is deliberately NOT routed through this. It predates the check, it is the
 * primary call-to-action's href, and event pages commonly drive registration from a scripted
 * button rather than an `<a href>` — so verifying it would strip working CTAs from existing
 * campaigns. That is a known gap, not an oversight.
