 * Server-side feature flags.
 *
 * The existing `feature-flag.service.ts` is the OpenFeature **Web** SDK: it runs in the
 * browser and returns Angular `Signal<T>`, so it cannot gate an Express handler. This
 * helper covers the server side only, and deliberately stays small — it exists so the
 * campaign-service cutover can move one endpoint at a time and roll a bad one back by
 * changing an environment variable, without shipping code.
 *
 * Env vars are read on EVERY call rather than captured at module load. A flag whose value
 * is frozen at import time cannot be rolled back without a restart, which defeats the point,
 * and it also makes the flag untestable without module-registry surgery. The cost is a map
 * lookup per request, which is nothing next to the proxied HTTP call it gates.
