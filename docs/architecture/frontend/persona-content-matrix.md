# Persona × Lens Content Matrix

Maps every persona to the sidebar links and key pages it can see in each lens. Use this as the source of truth when adding new nav items, writing persona regression tests, or auditing access gating.

For background on how personas and lenses are resolved, see [Lens & Persona System](./lens-system.md).

## Personas

| Persona              | How acquired                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contributor`        | Default project-scoped persona; assigned when no other project detection matches, or as a fallback |
| `maintainer`         | Has a `cdp_roles` detection carrying a `maintainer` role for a project                             |
| `board-member`       | Has a `board_member` detection on a foundation                                                     |
| `executive-director` | Has an `executive_director` detection on a foundation, OR is a root writer (injected)              |

A user can carry multiple personas simultaneously. When no explicit selection has been made, `PersonaService` defaults to the highest-priority persona (`executive-director` > `board-member` > `maintainer` > `contributor`). A user can explicitly **pin** a lower-priority persona (e.g., switch from ED to board-member view) — `PersonaService` preserves that choice across refreshes as long as the persona is still in the allowed set (`userSelected` flag). The active `currentPersona()` signal — not a static priority rule — drives which conditional sidebar sections are shown.

## Lenses and access rules

| Lens         | Who can use it                                                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `me`         | All authenticated users                                                             |
| `foundation` | Users with `hasBoardRole` (`board-member` or `executive-director`), or root writers |
| `project`    | Users with `hasProjectRole` (`maintainer` or `contributor`), or root writers        |
| `org`        | All users (feature-flagged via `ORG_LENS_ENABLED_FLAG`)                             |

A user can carry both board and project roles simultaneously. In the sidebar lens switcher, hybrid users see a single merged **project** lens entry instead of separate `foundation` and `project` buttons — `LensService.displayLenses` filters the `foundation` option for hybrids so the `project` button serves as the unified entry point for both.

## Key conditions referenced in the matrix

| Condition                 | Definition                                                                                                                         | Source                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `canWrite()`              | `ProjectContextService.canWrite` — reactive signal; true when the user has write/manage access to the active foundation or project | `project-context.service.ts` |
| `canSeeNewsletters()`     | `currentPersona() === 'executive-director' \|\| canWrite()`                                                                        | `main-layout.component.ts`   |
| `foundationHasProjects()` | True when the selected foundation has ≥1 project row in Snowflake; cleared while fetching                                          | `main-layout.component.ts`   |

## Me Lens

**Identical for all personas.** Static items — no runtime persona conditions.

## Project Lens

Available to `contributor`, `maintainer`, and root writers.

| Sidebar item / section     | Route                    | Visible to                                     |

### Project lens by persona summary

| Persona       | Sees Governance | Sees Newsletters (Communications) |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `contributor` | Yes             | Only if `canWrite()`              |
| `maintainer`  | Yes             | Only if `canWrite()`              |

> **Note:** `canWrite()` is resolved from `ProjectContextService` and reflects the user's write access to the currently-selected project, not their persona level globally. A `contributor` who is a project manager (write access) will see Newsletters.

---

## Org Lens

**Feature-flagged** via `ORG_LENS_ENABLED_FLAG`. When the flag is off, `orgLensEnabledGuard` (CanMatch) blocks all `/org/*` routes and redirects to `/` — the routes are invisible to the router. When enabled, the Org Lens is identical for all personas.

| Section         | Item                     | Route                |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| _(top-level)_   | Org Overview             | `/org/overview`      |
| Org Foundations | Memberships              | `/org/memberships`   |
|                 | Projects                 | `/org/projects`      |
|                 | ROI                      | `/org/roi`           |
|                 | Governance               | `/org/governance`    |
| Org Engagement  | People                   | `/org/people`        |
|                 | Code Contributions       | `/org/contributions` |
|                 | Events                   | `/org/events`        |
|                 | Training & Certification | `/org/training`      |
|                 | Meetings                 | `/org/meetings`      |
|                 | Committees               | `/org/groups`        |
| Org Admin       | Profile                  | `/org/profile`       |

## Route-level guards

Guards enforce access at the router level — regardless of whether a sidebar link is visible.

| Guard                    | Protected routes                                                                        | Access rule                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `executiveDirectorGuard` | `/foundation/health-metrics`, `/foundation/marketing-impact`, `/foundation/campaigns`   | `currentPersona() === 'executive-director'`                        |
| `newsletterAccessGuard`  | `/newsletters` (lens redirect), `/foundation/newsletters`, `/project/newsletters`       | `canSeeNewsletters()` — ED or `canWrite()`                         |
| `writerGuard`            | Create/edit routes for meetings, committees, mailing lists, surveys, votes (all lenses) | `executive-director` (fast path) or `canWrite()`                   |
| `orgLensEnabledGuard`    | `/org/*` (CanMatch — routes invisible when flag is off)                                 | `ORG_LENS_ENABLED_FLAG` must be `true`; redirects to `/` otherwise |

Guards are defined in `apps/lfx-one/src/app/shared/guards/`.

## Write-action gating per feature domain

The `writerGuard` protects create and edit routes. Within read-only pages, UI elements (add/edit/delete buttons) are additionally gated by `canWrite()` in the component template.

| Domain                 | Create/edit route guard | In-page UI gating                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Meetings               | `writerGuard`           | Yes                                                  |
| Committees             | `writerGuard`           | Yes                                                  |
| Mailing Lists          | `writerGuard`           | Yes                                                  |
| Surveys                | `writerGuard`           | Yes                                                  |
| Votes                  | `writerGuard`           | Yes                                                  |
| Settings / Permissions | —                       | `canWrite()` — view-only banner shown to non-writers |

> Backend write enforcement (whether the upstream microservices independently reject unauthorized writes) is tracked separately in [LFXV2-1662](https://linuxfoundation.atlassian.net/browse/LFXV2-1662).

---

## Session eviction on access loss

`evictOnWriteAccessLoss()` (`apps/lfx-one/src/app/shared/utils/`) subscribes to `canWrite` reactively. If write access is revoked mid-session (e.g., an admin removes the user's permission), the utility redirects to a safe page automatically.
