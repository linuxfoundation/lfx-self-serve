## Project Overview

LFX PCC is a Turborepo monorepo containing an Angular 19 SSR application with experimental zoneless change detection and Express.js server.

## Development Memories

- Always reference PrimeNG's component interface when trying to define types
- The project logo display is currently hardcoded but will be dynamic once API is integrated
- Metrics data is hardcoded but structured to match future API responses
- All PrimeNG components are wrapped in LFX components for UI library independence
- Always use direct imports for standalone components - no barrel exports
- Authentication is handled by Auth0 with express-openid-connect middleware
- Logging uses Pino for structured JSON logs with sensitive data redaction
- Health checks are available at /health and are not logged or authenticated
- All shared types, interfaces, and constants are centralized in @lfx-pcc/shared package
- Use TypeScript interfaces instead of union types for better maintainability
- Shared package uses direct source imports during development for hot reloading
- **Interfaces go into the shared packages**
- **License headers are required on all source files** - run `./check-headers.sh` to verify
- **Pre-commit hooks enforce license headers** - commits will fail without proper headers
- Always run yarn format from the root of the project to ensure formatting is done after you have made all your changes
- Always preprend "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)" if you assisted with the code
- Do not nest ternary expressions
- Always run yarn lint before yarn build to validate your linting
- The JIRA project key for this is LFXV2. All tickets associated to this repo should generally be in there.
- **E2E tests use dual architecture** - both content-based (_.spec.ts) and structural (_-robust.spec.ts) tests
- **Always add data-testid attributes** when creating new components for reliable test targeting
- **Run yarn e2e before major changes** to ensure all 85+ tests pass consistently
- **Use data-testid naming convention** - `[section]-[component]-[element]` for hierarchical structure
- **Test responsive behavior** - validate mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports appropriately
- When running tests to validate UI tests, use reporter=list
- Follow Angular commit conventions: `type(scope): description`
- Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Scope should be lowercase and describe the affected area (e.g., auth, ui, api, docs) and follow the angular scope conventions
- Use present tense, imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Examples:
  - `feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration`
  - `fix(ui): resolve mobile button alignment`
- All commits and pull requests need to be associated to a JIRA ticket. If there isn't one, we need to create it and reference it moving forward.
- Branch names should be following the commit types (feat,fix,docs, etc) followed by the JIRA ticket number. i.e; feat/LFXV2-123 or ci/LFXV2-456
- PR titles must also follow a similar format as conventional commits - `type(scope): description`. The scope has to follow the angular config for conventional commit and not include the JIRA ticket in the title, and everything should be in lowercase.

- All interfaces, resuable constants, and enums should live in the shared package.
